# React JIMP

> JIMP&#x27;s React implementation for image manipulation

[![NPM](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/react-jimp.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-jimp) [![JavaScript Style Guide](https://img.shields.io/badge/code_style-standard-brightgreen.svg)](https://standardjs.com)

## Installation

```bash
npm install --save react-jimp
```

Example usage (width, height and alt are optional):

```js
import { Jimage } from "react-jimp";
import testImage from "../assets/testimg.png";

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">

      // Pass the props as shown in the documentation
      <Jimage
        src={testImage}
        pixelate="5"
        mirror="true, false"
		greyscale
		color={[
			{ apply: 'hue', params: [-90]}
		]}
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Methods

Import the component from package

```js
{
	/* Resize */
	contain: "w, h",  // scale the image to the given width and height, some parts of the image may be letter boxed
	cover: "w, h", // scale the image to the given width and height, some parts of the image may be clipped
	resize: "w, h", // resize the image. Jimp.AUTO can be passed as one of the values.
	scale: "f",  // scale the image by the factor f
	scaleToFit: "w, h",  // scale the image to the largest size that fits inside the given width and height
	// An optional resize mode can be passed with all resize methods.

	/* Crop */
	autocrop: "tolerance, frames", // automatically crop same-color borders from image (if any), frames must be a Boolean
	autocrop: "options",  // automatically crop same-color borders from image (if any), options may contain tolerance, cropOnlyFrames, cropSymmetric, leaveBorder
	crop: "x, y, w, h",  // crop to the given region

	/* Flip and rotate */
	flip: "horz, vert",  // flip the image horizontally or vertically
	mirror: "horz, vert",  // an alias for flip
	rotate: "deg",  // rotate the image clockwise by a number of degrees. Optionally, a resize mode can be passed. If `false` is passed as the second parameter, the image width and height will not be resized.

	/* Colour */

	brightness: "val",  // adjust the brighness by a value -1 to +1
	contrast: "val", // adjust the contrast by a value -1 to +1
	dither565: "bool" , // ordered dithering of the image and reduce color space to 16-bits (RGB565)
	greyscale: "bool",  // remove colour from the image
	invert: "bool",  // invert the image colours
	normalize: "bool",  // normalize the channels in an image

	/* Alpha channel */

	hasAlpha: "bool",  // determines if an image contains opaque pixels
	fade: "f",  // an alternative to opacity, fades the image by a factor 0 - 1. 0 will haven no effect. 1 will turn the image
	opacity: "f",  // multiply the alpha channel by each pixel by the factor f, 0 - 1
	opaque: "bool",  // set the alpha channel on every pixel to fully opaque
	background: "hex",  // set the default new pixel colour (e.g. 0xFFFFFFFF or 0x00000000) for by some operations (e.g. image.contain and

	/* Blurs */

	gaussian: "r",  // Gaussian blur the image by r pixels (VERY slow)
	blur: "r", // fast blur the image by r pixels

	/* Effects */

	posterize: "n",  // apply a posterization effect with n level
	sepia: "bool",  // apply a sepia wash to the image
	pixelate: "size"  // apply a pixelation effect to the image
}
```

## Colour manipulation

```js
<Jimage
	src="./img.jpg"
	color={[
		{ apply: 'hue', params: [-90] },
		{ apply: 'lighten', params: [50] },
		{ apply: 'xor', params: ['#06D'] }
	]}
>
```

The method supports the following modifiers:

| Modifier | Description |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **lighten** {amount} | Lighten the color a given amount, from 0 to 100. Providing 100 will always return white (works through [TinyColor](https://github.com/bgrins/TinyColor)) |
| **brighten** {amount} | Brighten the color a given amount, from 0 to 100 (works through [TinyColor](https://github.com/bgrins/TinyColor)) |
| **darken** {amount} | Darken the color a given amount, from 0 to 100. Providing 100 will always return black (works through [TinyColor](https://github.com/bgrins/TinyColor)) |
| **desaturate** {amount} | Desaturate the color a given amount, from 0 to 100. Providing 100 will is the same as calling greyscale (works through [TinyColor](https://github.com/bgrins/TinyColor)) |
| **saturate** {amount} | Saturate the color a given amount, from 0 to 100 (works through [TinyColor](https://github.com/bgrins/TinyColor)) |
| **greyscale** {amount} | Completely desaturates a color into greyscale (works through [TinyColor](https://github.com/bgrins/TinyColor)) |
| **spin** {degree} | Spin the hue a given amount, from -360 to 360. Calling with 0, 360, or -360 will do nothing - since it sets the hue back to what it was before. (works through [TinyColor](https://github.com/bgrins/TinyColor)) |
| **hue** {degree} | Alias for **spin** |
| **mix** {color, amount} | Mixes colors by their RGB component values. Amount is opacity of overlaying color |
| **tint** {amount} | Same as applying **mix** with white color |
| **shade** {amount} | Same as applying **mix** with black color |
| **xor** {color} | Treats the two colors as bitfields and applies an XOR operation to the red, green, and blue components |
| **red** {amount} | Modify Red component by a given amount |
| **green** {amount} | Modify Green component by a given amount |
| **blue** {amount} | Modify Blue component by a given amount |
